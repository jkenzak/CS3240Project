# Textbook Exchange
Description

This is a web-based application for textbook exchange developed using Python and Django. The core features of the application include integration of class listing API, Google user accounts, and a messaging system. The project was originally forked from a private repository created specifically for the class

Contributions

As one of 5 members of the development team, I made 36 commits and contributed to almost 800 lines of code. My contributions included implementing the functionality for favoriting posts and adding other users as friends. I also served as the Scrum Master, overseeing team meetings and monitoring team status. Through this experience, I gained valuable knowledge and hands-on experience in agile software development methodologies, version control using GitHub, and cloud hosting using Heroku.

How to Run

To run the application, clone the repository on your local machine and then navigate to the virtual environment (venv/Scripts/activate). Then run the following command in the virtual environment:

python3 manage.py runserver

You can now access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8000/.
